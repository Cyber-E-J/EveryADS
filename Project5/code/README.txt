#What improved after PR

#About complie and generate executable document
The original program is complied in Windows by Vscode.
Normally, by "g++ huffman.cpp"in cmd can complie and generate executable document.
If you have trouble on generating, you can use a.exe which had generated.

#About code document
The "huffman.cpp" is the final complete program which can solve the "huffman code" problem.
(As we can't give the enough large data to test, we sincerely recommand you to copy the code and test it on the PAT
https://pintia.cn/problem-sets/16/problems/671)

#About the input data
Each input file contains one test case. 
For each case, the first line gives an integer N (2≤N≤63), 
then followed by a line that contains all the N distinct characters and their frequencies in the following format:
c[1] f[1] c[2] f[2] ... c[N] f[N]
where c[i] is a character chosen from {'0' - '9', 'a' - 'z', 'A' - 'Z', '_'}, 
and f[i] is the frequency of c[i] and is an integer no more than 1000. 

The next line gives a positive integer M (≤1000), then followed by M student submissions. 
Each student submission consists of N lines, each in the format:
c[i] code[i]
where c[i] is the i-th character and code[i] is an non-empty string of no more than 63 '0's and '1's.

An example input:
7
A 1 B 1 C 1 D 3 E 3 F 6 G 6
4
A 00000
B 00001
C 0001
D 001
E 01
F 10
G 11
A 01010
B 01011
C 0100
D 011
E 10
F 11
G 00
A 000
B 001
C 010
D 011
E 100
F 101
G 110
A 00000
B 00001
C 0001
D 001
E 00
F 10
G 11

 
#About output
For each test case, print in each line either "Yes" if the student's submission is correct, or "No" if not.
Note: The optimal solution is not necessarily generated by Huffman algorithm. 
Any prefix code with code length being optimal is considered correct.

The supposed output of the input above
Yes
Yes
No
No

Thanks you for your judgement and forgive my poor English:)
