Item 1: 1 point

the introduction is clear 



Item 2: 2 points( -1 )

the descriptions of the key data structures is given, but the given program lack comments and specification. Plus, there are two possible ways to determine the prefix code(as descripted), but only the latter one is implemented.

only a program + comments, which is not acceptable (-1)others â€“ please specify in the final comments.



Item 3: 1 point

the file is neat.



Item 4: 3 points (-1)

A complete table of testing data is not given in Chapter 3 with performance data. (we are told that the pta result is not a solid/complete proof that your program is correct.)



Item 5: 3 points(-1)

quote "in this problem, it's suppose to give M lists", so the time complexity should be O(MN^2) or O(MNlogN). You have confused M and N in your analysis.



Item 6: 9 points

The program runs fine and well commented.
